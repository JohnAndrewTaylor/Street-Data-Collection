 The spreadsheet is meant as a way to store previous data collected, either by hand or through the app, and also as a way of viewing this data in an organized, computerized manner that can be used by the app and map we have created. It can also be used to create charts as different ways of viewing the entered data. This way, data can be stored and viewed over time in a digitized way. The horizontal categories across the top label different problems or attributes that a certain neighborhood or house in that neighbor has. The vertical labels are the different streets for a certain sheet, with each house on the street differentiated by their house number. If a house or neighborhood has a certain attribute, the box that contains both the attribute and the house will be marked with a 1. If the box is empty, then there is no attribute for that house that applies. For example, 1209 Marco Dr has a problem with abandoned cars in the street, so the box intersecting both these labels is marked with a 1. It has no basketball goals, so that box is empty.
